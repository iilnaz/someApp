- This is my attempt at writing a simple CRUD application using a clean architecture.
- Gorilla Mux was used as the router. Postgres was used as the database(raised in the Docker). You can use all what you want, just implement needed interfaces.
- The application is not overloaded with any specific business logic (more precisely, it has no business logic :)), so it can be used as a template.
